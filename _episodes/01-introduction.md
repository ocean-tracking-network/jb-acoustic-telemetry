##  Intended Audience
This workshop is directed at researchers who are ready to begin the work of telemetry data analysis. Other workshops exist to help bring individuals up to speed so that they can ingest the following lessons.  If you need to refresh your R coding skills, we recommend [Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/ "Website for R ecology lesson") as a good starting point.

##  Intro to Telemetry Data Analysis
OTN, FACT and GLATOS all provide researchers with preformatted data sets, which are easily ingested into the data analysis tools.
Before diving into alot of analysis, it is important to take the time to clean and sort your data set, taking the preformatted files and combining them in different ways, allowing you to analyse the data with different questions in mind.
There are multiple R packages necessary for efficient and thorough telemetry data analysis.  
-R packages used

##  Intro to the GLATOS Package

Developed by Chris Holbrook of GLATOS, OTN helps to maintain and keep relevant.
-false filtering, minlag
-summarise and plot, including maps
